## What is Devcord?

Devcord is a cloned version of the popular messaging platform, [Discord](discord.com). Devcord allows users to come together and build communities through servers and create specific text-channels that have real-time messaging. This allows users to have special connections with groups of people with similiar interests.

## Technologies Used

Devcord is a full-stack application using Javascript and React as the frontend and Ruby on Rails as the backend. For the real-time chat feature, I used
Ruby on Rails' version of websockets, ActionCable.
